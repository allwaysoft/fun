1. Associative Arrays (Index by Tables)
Uses:
Use it to hold a few thousand rows not more than 5000 maybe.
This has to be declared as record, not object

Advantages:
No need to Extend

Disadvantages:
Can not be declared at schema level
Cannot be manipulated with DML statements
Passing collections to and from the database server
Deletions not possible
Associative arrays cannot be stored in DB column

No direct interaction with SQL (Before 12C, form 12C, this is possible)

2. Nested Tables
Uses
When used to hold data like a table row, this has to be declared as object when done in SQL (Schema level), as record when done at PL/SQL level
a. Usage in SQL
create type i_name is table of nvarchar2(512);
i_itemname i_name; 

Once created as above and populated with data, it can be used in SQL in the below form

select count(*) into c from all_tables
    where owner in (select * from table(i_itemname));

OR

select count(*) into c
    from table(i_itemname) t
    join all_tables at on at.owner = t.column_value;
Advantages:
Deletions and updates possible
Nested table structure can be stored in a db database column, which means the data in nested tables can be stored in DB.

Disadvantages

3. Varrays (Rarely used)
Advantages:


Disadvantages:
Need to know the upper boundary in advance
