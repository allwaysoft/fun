Oracle Vs SQL Server
--------------------
Oracle, with primary key, doesnâ€™t have table data sorted in the index order but SQL Server has data stored in PK index order
No DML in functions in SQL Server but possible in Oracle
Oracle you can drop a partition, Sql Server only truncate a partition
Oracle has UNDO which makes it possible to read and write to a table at the same time but in SQL Server, by default, when reads are done, updating those rows is not possible because there is a shared lock on the data which is being read but this can be avoided by changing the isolation level of SQL Server to READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT and ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION db options. By setting those options, sql server behaves as Oracle and reads and updates of the same rows is possible at the same time.
SQL Server has If exists (Select 1) in TSQL but Oracle does not have it.

MySql
-----
Cons:
1. Field trimming with out notification. A varchar 2 filed will not fail when a string of 3 is tried and inserted. It will be trimmed to 2 and will be inserted silently
2. The primary key and null constraints are not honored. Which means nulls could be inserted in to pk fields

DynamoDB
