Deleting the whole backend project from local and reclone from github had the below issues
——————————————————————————————————————————————

Jfrog access denied issue when I tried mvn clean install after cloning the project.
I copied /Users/kranthipingup/.m2/settings.xml to desktop and removed .m2 directory
Closed backend project from intellij and Xed it out from intellij list and reopened the project.
ran mvn clean install and it all looked good but then the PublisherDataManipulationBingImpl had red for ‘import generated.Businesses;’ then had to do cmd+shift+A and do ‘reimport all maven projects’.
All was fixed then
